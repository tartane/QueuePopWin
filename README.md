<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>
Queue Pop captures sounds on your computer and then utilizes audio fingerprinting techniques to identify matchmaking sounds from games. When it detects a match from its fingerprinting data, it sends a notification to your linked mobile device. By utilizing sound, Queue Pop is versatile and can be easily adapted to a wide range of games.

Audio fingerprinting sounds familiar? It is the same technique utilized by music identifying apps such as Shazam and SoundHound.</p>
